This project, while it is a requirement for graduation, started as an off-hand 
statement to a colleague.  He used himself and his two children to point in the 
direction of an alligator when it made its infamous bellow.  It seemed clear 
that this function could be performed in hardware.  The goal of this project is
to identify an acoustic signal and provide its direction relative to the audio 
sensors.  This problem is solved by using an analog-to-digital converter to 
sample the acoustic environment and then process that signal against the desired
signal of interest using a digital signal processor and signal processing 
techniques.  This entire project was first designed in Matlab and Simulink to 
produce a proof of concept and then implemented in hardware on the TMS320C6713 
evaluation board by Spectrum Digital.  The result is a hardware implementation 
that can successfully identify an acoustic signal of interest and provide 
direction with an approximate 16% false rejection rate.
